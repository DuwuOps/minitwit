## Evolution, Operation, and Maintenance

The group applied DevOps strategies to deliver a product with fast feedback loops to improve quality in our work. This is summarized in three key areas:

### Visible Work

- **Kanban board**: Provided an overview of work and progress.
- **Issue assignment**: Clarified responsibility.
- **Acceptance criteria**: Set clear goals for each task.
- **Conventions**: Standardised commits, PRs, and reviews.
- **Knowledge exchange**: Ensured shared understanding across the team.

### Minimal Branch Sizing

- Used small branches for faster reviews.
- Reduced merge conflicts and integration delays.

### Pipeline

Pipelines helped shorten lead time by:

- **CI**: A autonomous process that provided quick feedback on code changes.
- **Security alerts**
- **Automatic updates**: Reduced manual maintenance.
- **Automated tests**: Ensured confidence during development and refactoring.
