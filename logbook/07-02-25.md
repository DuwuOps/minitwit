# DevOps Notes – 07/02/25  
The team met after the lecture to discuss workflow, exercises, and the choice of programming language for our project.

## Key Notes  
- **Workflow** → Tracking our work using a GitHub board.  
- **Exercises** → Worked on Docker-related tasks from the week's exercises.  
- **Programming Language Choice** → Evaluated and selected a technology for the project.  

## Project Setup & Workflow  
- Created a GitHub project to track work using issues.  
- Managing tasks through a backlog with issue states: **To Do, In Progress, Done**.  
- The goal is to link our work with the time spent on each issue and maintain an overview of the code.  

## Docker Exercises  
- Set up and ran a local instance of **MiniTwit** using Docker on each team member's machine.  
- Discussed and clarified issues encountered during the setup.  

## Programming Language Discussion  
We explored various programming languages and agreed on using a **new technology** where none of us had in-depth experience. Our decision was based on the following criteria:  
- Strong **documentation** and **community support**.  
- Modern, actively maintained, and widely used in the **industry**.  
- Well-suited for our **project domain**.  
- Built-in **concurrency support**.  

After evaluating **Java, C#, Go, and Crystal**, we concluded that since we had prior experience with **Java and C#**, we preferred to explore something new. We also noted that Java and C# are **object-oriented**, requiring more boilerplate code for similar functionality. This led us to compare **Go** and **Crystal**.  

### **Go vs Crystal Comparison**  

| Topic / Lang          | GoLang                                      | Crystal                                   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Team Competences**  | Some prior exposure in small capacities  | No prior experience                     |
| **Ecosystem & Libraries** | Well-supported, uses GitHub          | Uses GitHub, but less extensive         |
| **Industry Usage**    | Extensive adoption (StackOverflow Survey 2024) | Limited adoption (StackOverflow Survey 2024) |
| **Docker Compatibility** | Yes                                       | Yes                                      |
| **Performance**       | Fast                                      | Fast                                     |
| **Concurrency**       | Strong support                           | Good                                     |
| **Documentation**     | Well-documented                         | Good but less extensive                 |
| **Community**        | Large and active                         | Smaller and less active                 |

### **Final Decision**  
We chose **Go** for the following reasons:  
- **Maturity** – Well-established and battle-tested.  
- **Extensive support** – Rich ecosystem and robust tooling.  
- **Industry popularity** – Widely used in DevOps, cloud computing, and backend development.
