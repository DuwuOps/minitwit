    ### Process' perspective

    This perspective should clarify how code or other artifacts come from idea into the running system and everything that happens on the way.

    In particular, the following descriptions should be included:

    - A complete description of stages and tools included in the CI/CD chains, including deployment and release of your systems.
    - How do you monitor your systems and what precisely do you monitor?
    - What do you log in your systems and how do you aggregate logs?
    - Brief results of the security assessment and brief description of how did you harden the security of your system based on the analysis.
    - Applied strategy for scaling and upgrades.

    In case you have used AI-assistants during your project briefly explain which system(s) you used during the project and reflect how it supported or hindered your process.
