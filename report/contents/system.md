# System perspective

This section presents the system.

## Design and architecture 
The system is primarily built using Go (Golang) for backend development. The Echo web framework is used for HTTP routing and middleware management. PostgreSQL serves as the database. Additionally, the system uses various Go libraries for security, session management, data serialization, monitoring, system metrics and external systems that will be presented later. 

This section presents the architecture of the system by exploring the `src` folder of the repository.

### Module diagram

An overview of the modules of the codebase in the `src` folder is presented by the following package diagram.    
Note that within the `handlers` folder, the classes `auth.go`, `message.go`, and `user.go` and their dependencies are highlighted, depicting the complexity of this central module. This is thereby not a normal package diagram.

![Module diagram](../images/module_diagram.png)

In the diagram, it can be seen that the `main.go` file orchestrates the system. It is responsible for:  
1. Rendering the templates (frontend)  
2. Initializing a new instance of the database object  
3. Setting up middleware  
4. Setting up routes, which expose endpoints that delegate logic to the `handlers` module for API processing.

#### Description of modules

| Module                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Sequence diagrams
Below, two sequence diagrams showcase how the different parts of the system interact when procecssing a "Follow" request. The first version shows the processes involved when the request is sent via. the UI, whereas the second version shows the processes involved when sent via. the API. 

![Sequence diagram - Follow request via UI](../images/sequence_diagram_follow_UI.png)

![Sequence diagram - Follow request via API](../images/sequence_diagram_follow_API.png)

Note that while both versions use the same API, they use different endpoints.

## Current state of the system

### SonarQube analysis summary

The following table summarizes key code quality metrics from SonarQube analysis:

| Metric                 | Value                  |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Lines of Code (LOC)    | 1,591                  |
| Code Duplication       | 4.1%                   |
| Security Hotspots      | 8                      |
| Overall Rating         | A (Excellent quality)  |
| Cyclomatic Complexity  | 216 (handlers: 151)    |
| Technical Debt         | ~1 hour 7 minutes      |

### Code Climate

The following table summarizes key code quality metrics from Code Climate analysis:

| Metric                 | Value                  |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Lines of Code (LOC)    | 1,912                  |
| Code Duplication       | 0%                     |
| Overall Rating         | A (Excellent quality)  |
| Complexity             | 299 (handlers: 196)    |
| Technical Debt         | ~1 day 2 hours         |

### Overall assessment

Both tools show that the `handlers` module has relatively high complexity, which may require focused attention for maintainability.

## Deployment

### Allocation viewpoint

![Deployment diagram](../images/deployment_diagram.png)

## Database (PostgreSQL)

Our setup includes two PostgreSQL databases: one for production and one for testing. Each runs on a separate, containerized droplet, with access restricted via a firewall to ensure security and isolation between environments (see Figure 1).

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) was to replace the SQLite setup, due to strong SQL standards compliance [@do_dbcomparison], high community adoption [@stackoverflow_survey_2024], advanced features (e.g., JSON, HStore, Security) [@tooljet_mariavspostgres], [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison].

### Choice of Technology - Database

To replace our current SQLite setup, we compared leading relational databases based on the Stack Overflow 2024 Developer Survey [@stackoverflow_survey_2024]. Only open-source, self-hosted RDBMSs were consideredâ€”excluding NoSQL and cloud services.

| **Database** | **SQLite** | **PostgreSQL** | **MySQL** | **Oracle** | **SQL Server** | **MariaDB** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Popularity** | 33.1% [@stackoverflow_survey_2024] | 49.7% [@stackoverflow_survey_2024] | 40.3% [@stackoverflow_survey_2024] | 10.1% [@stackoverflow_survey_2024] | 25.3% [@stackoverflow_survey_2024] | 17.2% [@stackoverflow_survey_2024] |
| **License** | Public-Domain [@sqlite_license] | Open-Source [@postgresql_license] | Open-Source & Proprietary [@MySQL_license] | Proprietary | Proprietary [@microsoftsqlserver_license] | Open-Source [@mariadb_license] |
| **Standards Compliance** [@SQL_Standard_ISO] | Low [@do_dbcomparison] | Compliant [@do_dbcomparison] | Limited [@do_dbcomparison] | *Unknown* | *Unknown* | Fork of MySQL; Assumed limited |
| **Max Connections** | 1 | 500,000+ [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison] | 100,000+ [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison] | *Unknown* | *Unknown* | 200,000+ [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison] |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | No | Yes [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison] | Yes [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison] | *Unknown* | *Unknown* | Yes [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison] |
| **Concurrency Handling** | None | Excellent [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison] | Moderate [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison] | *Unknown* | *Unknown* | Strong [@Medium_Peymaan_DB_Comparison] |

Table: Comparison of RDBMSs.
**Note**: Performance benchmarks are excluded due to license restrictions placed on benchmarking by licensing of proprietary DBMSs [@Oracle_Network_License].
 
MySQL was ruled out due to licensing issues and development concerns post-Oracle acquisition [@Fedora_MariaDB], [@do_dbcomparison].
