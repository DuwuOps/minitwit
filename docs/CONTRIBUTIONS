# Contribution Guidelines

This document describes the agreed upon contribution guidelines by group "*DuwuOps*"' regarding their MiniTwit DevOps project.

## Tasks & Cooperation
1. A task must be completed through *cooperation*.
2. A task must be assigned to *at least* 2 contributors, who share the responsibility of it's completion.   
3. The process of completing a task should, unless specified otherwise, be completed through [*pair-programming*](https://qentelli.com/thought-leadership/insights/introduction-pair-programming#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20a%20concept,the%20accuracy%20of%20the%20code). 
    * Unless it is deemed unecessary for a task, in which case, a task will be assigned the label *exempt from pair programming*.

## GitHub Issues

1. Tasks must be represented by an appropriate GitHub issue.
2. A GitHub issue must be moved to the column of *‘done’* on completion of it's contents and the merging of it's associated branch.
3. A GitHub issue must include a list of *acceptance-criteria*.
4. A GitHub issue must be assigned an appropriate *label* upon creation.
5. A GitHub issue must be associated with a *time-spent* notion upon completion.

## Branches

* All branches must be associated to a **task** (GitHub issue).
* Pull-Requests must be approved by at least **2** other group members before a merge can commence.
    * These **2** members should not be part of the task's assigned contributors. 


## Commits

1. The work of a task must be split into several commits of an appropriate size.
2. Each commit message must follow specification for [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
#### Prefixes
Each commit message must use a *prefix* - denoting the type of change performed.
These are:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

#### Co-authoring

If the changes in a commit has been performed by multiple contributors, then [standards for co-authoring](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors) must be included in the commit.

#### Example

    $ git commit -m "Prefix : commit-message
    >  Co-authored-by: NAME <NAME@EXAMPLE.COM>"
